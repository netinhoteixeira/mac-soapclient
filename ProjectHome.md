[SOAP Client](http://ditchnet.org/soapclient)

SOAP Client uses WSDL files you provide to dynamically create a graphical user interface for any given SOAP-based web service. Here's how:

  * Find a SOAP-based web service that also has an accompanying WSDL description file.
  * Launch SOAP Client 1.0 and paste the URL of a remote WSDL file into the 'WSDL' text field, or download the WSDL file to your local system and find it using the 'Browse' Button.
  * Click the 'Parse' button.
  * Watch in wonder as SOAP Client dynamically builds a graphical user interface for the SOAP-based web service described by the given WSDL file.
  * Use this newly-created UI to select your desired method and input your parameter values. SOAP Client will automatically take care of adding the Endpoint URI, method namespace, and SOAPAction headers.
  * Click the 'Execute' button.
  * Now view both the SOAP request and response in the tabbed view below.
